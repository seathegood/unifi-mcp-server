## Integration with Existing Features

### Zone-Based Firewall Integration

The quick-block application tool seamlessly integrates with Phase 1 (ZBF):

```python
# Automatically detects and uses ZBF if available
await block_flow_application(
    site_id="default",
    flow_id="suspicious_flow",
    settings=settings,
    use_zbf=True,  # Try ZBF first
    zone_id="internal_zone",  # Optional specific zone
    confirm=True
)
```

### Traditional Firewall Fallback

If ZBF is not available or fails, automatically creates traditional firewall rules:

```python
# Fallback chain:
# 1. Try ZBF blocking in specified zone
# 2. Try ZBF blocking in default zone
# 3. Create traditional firewall rule
# 4. Return comprehensive result with rule_id or zone_id
```

### Audit Trail Integration

All block actions are automatically audited:

```python
# Audit details include:
# - Action type (block_flow_source_ip, etc.)
# - Resource ID (flow_id)
# - Target (IP or application_id)
# - Rule ID or Zone ID
# - Timestamp
# - Site ID
```
